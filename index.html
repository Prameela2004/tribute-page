          <h2>Iron Man of India</h2>
          <p>
            <b> Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel<br>born on October 31, 1875, in Gujarat, India, emerged as a pivotal figure in the Indian independence movement. Trained in law, he joined the Indian National Congress and became a staunch follower of Mahatma Gandhi's principles of non-violent resistance. Patel played a crucial role in organizing various civil disobedience movements, including the Bardoli Satyagraha, earning him the title of "Sardar" or leader.

            Post-independence, Patel served as the Deputy Prime Minister and the first Home Minister of India. He undertook the monumental task of integrating over 500 princely states into the Indian Union, demonstrating exceptional diplomatic skills and strategic acumen. His efforts ensured the territorial integrity and unity of India.
            
            Sardar Patel's vision and leadership continue to resonate in modern India, where he is revered as the "Iron Man of India." His legacy of nation-building, unity, and strong governance remains an enduring inspiration for generations. Patel passed away on December 15, 1950, leaving behind a profound imprint on the collective consciousness of the nation.
